MGScopeBar TODO


- Maybe properly support a blue gradient appearance (like Mail in Tiger)?
	- Easy to change background gradient, but buttons/popups still highlight gray.

- Accessibility support
	- The control needs to indicate which groups it contains, what selection-mode those groups support, etc.
	- Otherwise it's just an opaque group of buttons to VoiceOver.
