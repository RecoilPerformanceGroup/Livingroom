Livingroom
==========

This is the code for a dance piece with software. In Living Room Recoil Performance Group has created a room where the floor moves under the dancers.

The software continues the evolotion of our framework ofxCocoaPlugins, a midi and osc-addressable wrapper for openFrameworks that integrates calibration of infrared tracking, projection mapping and cocoa.

Here's a trailer:
